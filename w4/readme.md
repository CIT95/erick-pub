## Simple genre picker
I'm not picky with the type of music i listen to so i have a bit of a hard time picking why type of music im going to listen to. But i do have problems picking the type of music i do want to listen to. So this small program will pick out 3 genres of music that you should listen to thoughout the day with more relaxed types in the morning, a mix of upbeat and relaxing in the afternoon and more upbeat music at night(since im more of a night owl myself). I also really wanted to try and make this more complex but i dont quite understand while statements yet.
